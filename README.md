# 🧟‍♂️ Zombie Initiative Detection & Enterprise Risk Dashboard

This project identifies hidden, resource-draining initiatives — often called **Zombie Initiatives** — that consume budgets but fail to deliver measurable impact.

Organizations unknowingly lose millions every year to such underperforming projects. This solution combines **SQL, Python, and Power BI** to detect these initiatives, quantify financial waste, and provide leadership with data-driven risk visibility.

##  The Business Problem

Enterprises often run projects that:

- Overconsume budgets  
- Show minimal or no improvement in KPIs  
- Remain active despite clear underperformance  

These **Zombie Initiatives** silently drain resources, distort portfolio performance, and reduce organizational efficiency.

## 💡 Solution Overview

This project uses structured datasets, SQL logic, Python analysis, and interactive dashboards to:

✔ Detect initiatives with:  
   - Zero team activity logged  
   - No measurable improvement in KPIs  
   - Budget overspend exceeding defined thresholds  

✔ Calculate:  
   - Total wasted budget across Zombie initiatives  
   - Average financial loss per underperforming project  

✔ Provide:  
   - Visual dashboards highlighting initiative risk  
   - Data-driven insights to improve project governance
